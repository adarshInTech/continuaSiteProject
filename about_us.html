                                            While working for children with special care needs and their families she has experienced that our society and community is not equipped to manage these children and support them and their
                                            families which has motivated me to take a step forward by providing guidance and help to our uniquely-abled children and their families through multiple center providing coordinated services and
                                            reduce disability by focusing on a child’s strengths and building self-esteem through inclusiveness. Her dream is to have a community which respects equal rights and legitimate Laws to support our
